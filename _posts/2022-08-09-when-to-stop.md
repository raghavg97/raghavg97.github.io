When is the research "significant"?
-----------------------------------

From my PhD experience, I realized that the main role of publication is to convey my research idea to the world. As a researcher, it is never like "I found something" and everyone starts appreaciating that researcher. Most of the times, it is about how well I write about the research and how useful it is to other researchers or practitioners or the humanity. 

With that being said, having a novel result is always hard and having a 'high impact' result is even harder. Many times, I know and I feel that there is a high impact result just at the end of the tunnel but the tunnel is never ending. It is important to publish the "half-way result" and keep moving. Why is it so? From a personal point of view, publications are necessary for the career growth and it is not a great idea to delay a publication hoping for better results. Looking at the big picture, when I can publish a half-way result, I communincate my findings to other researchers so that they can reach the end of the tunnel if they see it. This is pretty important in keep pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.  

As important it is the "half-way" result, it is equally important to know and show that the research I do is actually siginificant distance into the tunnel and not just a few steps. This is the hardest part for me, currently - deciding "where to stop"? Sometimes, the tunnel is just unexplored and just taking a few steps, I can see the light at the end. But if I keep walking, the light does not look like it is nearing at all. Probably, I should just stop and publish it!
